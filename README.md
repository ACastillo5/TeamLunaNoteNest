# TeamLunaNoteNest

# Project Overview
This project will be creating a database that can be used by current and previous students 
to upload or look at notes if they need help understanding material. Professors will also be
able to use this to manage notes by being able to delete notes if they deem it violating 
any Academic Integrity rules

# Setup Instructions

- Creating a database that has the file types of .docx, .pdf, etc.

- Implement a method for professors to manage notes
- Add a system to rate notes based on how students like or dislike them

# Usage Details

be difficult for them. Professors will use this to see if notes are violating any academic 
integrity rules

## How to get started
- Open the folder you want the repository in
    - Open terminal and type: `git clone https://github.com/ACastillo5/TeamLunaNoteNest.git`
        - It will clone all the files to your local computer. You should be able to see the same files in GitHub
- Install Node modules
    - You would need `Node.js` for this
    - In terminal run: `npm install`
        - It will download a folder labeled `node_modules`. Once you see this file, you don't necessarily need to run 'npm install' again.
- Run nodemon
    - In terminal, run: `npx nodemon app`
- Open your browser and type in `localhost:3000`
